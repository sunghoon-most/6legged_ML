## Abstract 

  For legged robots, collecting ground-related tactile information is essential for stable posture and efficient gait. However, mounting sensors on small robots weighing less than 1 kg remain challenges in terms of the sensor’s durability, flexibility, sensitivity, and size. Crack-based sensors featuring ultra-sensitivity, small-size, and flexibility could be a promising candidate for a small robot tactile perception system. However, performance degradation of crack-based sensors due to crack growing by repeated use is a stumbling block. This paper presents an ultra-stable, tough, bio-inspired, mechanical crack-based strain sensor by controlling the depth of nano-crack using silver nanowire (Ag NW) mesh as a crack stop layer. The Ag NW mesh inspired by collagen structure of skin effectively mitigated crack propagation at the tip of the designed crack depth. The sensor was very thin (~10 μm), lightweight (~6 mg), ultra-sensitive (GF 2000 at 0.5 % strain), and ultra-durable that maintains its sensitivity during 200,000 cycles of 0.5 % strain. We demonstrate our sensor's feasibility by implementing the tactile sensation to bio-inspired robots, and propose statistical and deep learning-based analysis methods which successfully distinguished four types of terrain. The resulting technology suggests that it will be a breakthrough to enable autonomous control of small robots.
