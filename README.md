  Fig. 1 : Overview of ULTIMAC sensor and its robotic application in terrain sensing
a Schematic layup of the ULTIMAC sensor used in this work. The inset shows the SEM image of nano metal cracks (Scale bar: 2 μm). b Image of skin that its remarkable toughness with high flexibility. c Skin consists of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis. The collagen fibers that make up most of the dermis are curvy and disordered in a non-stressed state but becomes rearranged toward tensile load direction under a stressed state. The inset shows the SEM image of artificial skin collagen (Scale bar: 10 μm). d Image of a tough ULTIMAC sensor. The lateral dimensions are 5 mm x 30 mm on 10 μm-thick substrate (Scale bar: 1cm). e The ULTIMC sensor consists of four layers: a metalized layer, a cured PI layer, an Ag NW mesh layer, and a PI substrate. The embedded Ag NW layer mitigates crack growth. The inset shows the SEM image of an Ag NW mesh (Scale bar: 1 μm). f Schematic illustration of a robotic application sensing terrain information by mounting an ULTIMAC sensors on robot feet, Inset: Photograph of an ULTIMAC sensor mounted on a robot foot (Scale bar: 1 mm). g Schematic illustration of terrain information derived from bending deformation data of robot feet. h The attached sensor to the compliant robot foot for detecting bending strain. i Schematic illustration of crack propagation with and without the Ag NW layer.
